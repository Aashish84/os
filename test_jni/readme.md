A shared library, also known as a dynamic link library (DLL) in Windows or a shared object (SO) in Unix/Linux, is a binary file containing compiled code and data that can be loaded and executed by multiple programs at the same time. Shared libraries are designed to be shared across multiple processes, reducing memory footprint and allowing efficient code reuse.


```
gcc -shared -I"%JAVA_HOME%\include" -I"%JAVA_HOME%\include\win32" -m64 -o systemcallexample.dll SystemCallExample.c
```

explanation of each part of the command:

1. `gcc`: This is the command to invoke the GNU Compiler Collection, which includes the C and C++ compilers.

2. `-shared`: This option tells the compiler to create a shared library (DLL on Windows). It specifies that the output should be a dynamically linked library that can be loaded and executed by multiple programs.

3. `-I"%JAVA_HOME%\include"`: This option includes the directory containing the JNI header files. `%JAVA_HOME%` is an environment variable that should point to the Java installation directory. The JNI header files are necessary for interfacing Java code with native code using the Java Native Interface.

4. `-I"%JAVA_HOME%\include\win32"`: This option includes the directory containing the platform-specific JNI header files for Windows. It's required to properly compile JNI code on Windows.

5. `-m64`: This option is specific to 64-bit systems and instructs the compiler to generate code for a 64-bit architecture. This option is useful when building a shared library that targets 64-bit systems specifically.

6. `-o systemcallexample.dll`: This option specifies the output filename for the shared library (DLL). In this case, the output file will be named `systemcallexample.dll`.

7. `SystemCallExample.c`: This is the name of the C source file that contains the code for the system call example.

Putting it all together, the command is compiling the `SystemCallExample.c` C source file into a 64-bit shared library (DLL) named `systemcallexample.dll`. The resulting DLL can be used to make the system call from Java code via JNI on a 64-bit Windows system.
